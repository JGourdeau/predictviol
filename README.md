# predictviol
Final project for QSS 20 - The aim of this project is to use the features within the DOL quarterly Jobs data (considered the universe of employers) to predict whether an H2A employer will be investigated for a violation or be found to have violated worker's rights as listed within the WHD Violations Data.
